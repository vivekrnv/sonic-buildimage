The calculation formula for wred_threshold_limit is as follows:
egress_lossless_pool total size / 12 / 1024
Where:
- egress_lossless_pool total size = 136209408 bytes
- 12 represents the number of queues
- 1024 is used to convert the unit from bytes to KB

The result is 11084 (rounded down).

So, wred_threshold_limit = 136209408 / 12 / 1024 = 11084 (KB per queue)

The final total value is:
11084 (KB) * 12 (queues) * 1024 = 136200192 bytes
#}
{% set wred_threshold_limit = 136200192 %}

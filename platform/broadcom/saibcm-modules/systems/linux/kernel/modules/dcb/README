DCB Library

The DCB Library is a stand-alone library that allows access to 
DCB fields easily without bringing all the complexity of the 
SDK source tree.


DCB Initialization

The following routine initializes a DCB handle.  A unique DCB handle
needs to be initialized for a given device ID and revision ID.

This initialization function needs to be called before accessing
any DCB field.

Function:
#include <appl/dcb/dcb.h>

  int dcb_handle_init(dcb_handle_t *handle, uint16 dev_id, uint8 rev_id);

Parameters:
  handle    - (IN/OUT) Pointer to DCB library handle
  device_id - (IN)     Device ID
  rev_id    - (IN)     Revision ID

Returns:
  DCB_OK    Success
  DCB_ERROR Failure


DCB Field GET

Set of macros that return the value from a DCB field.

The correct DCB structure needs to be allocated and
initialized prior to calling any of the get/set macros.

Macro:
  DCB_<field>_GET(handle, dcb)

Parameters:
  handle - (IN) Pointer to the handle for a given device;
           type is dcb_handle_t *
  dcb    - (IN) Pointer to the DCB structure to get the field value from;
           type is dcb_t *
Returns:
  Value of DCB field


DCB Field SET

Set of macros to set the value for a DCB field.

The correct DCB structure needs to be allocated and
initialized prior to calling any of the get/set macros.

Macro:
  DCB_<field>_SET(handle, dcb, value)

Parameters:
  handle - (IN) Pointer to the handle for a given device;
           type is dcb_handle_t *
  dcb    - (IN/OUT) Pointer to the DCB structure to set the field value to;
           type is dcb_t *
  value  - (IN) Value to set for the DCB field;
           type varies

Returns:
  None


Compiling the DCB Library

To compile the DCB library, the DCBDIR environment variable needs
to be set to point to the location where the DCB library resides
and run make. If DCBDIR is not set, the default value of DCBDIR is the parent
directory of this README file.

The DCB library output will be generated in $DCBDIR/build/ by default.
The output directory can be specified by setting the BLDDIR environment
variable.

Example:
  cd <dcb_dir>
  export DCBDIR=`pwd`
  cd make
  make

Dell S6100 64x40G support 
------------------------

summary:-
S6100 has 64 x 40G port capacity
S6100 supports 4 IO Modules which are pluggable. Below section covers how to power on IO modules
and initialize the device drivers and configure necessary mux to send traffic.


Necessary drivers and scripts to package 

1) Users are expected to build necessary drivers for kernel and package to acess it on the target

    a) Mgmt phy driver  
      This supports BCM 54616 phy driver ( enable CONFIG_IGB in kernel config)
    b) driver-support-sff-8436-eeprom.patch 
    c) driver-support-sff-8436-eeprom-update.patch
    This driver supports QSFP EEPROM
    d) dell_s6100_iom_cpld.ko   
    This driver provides support for cpld on 4 x 40Gig-IOM modules
    e) i2c_mux_pca954x.ko
    This driver provides support for i2c mux/switch (pca954x)
    f) dell_s6100_lpc.ko
    This driver porivide support for reading all the platform info from SMF. 


2) Users are also expected to package below scripts for platform initialization and i2c tree creation 

    a) iom_power.sh
    This script is used to power on IO modules on S6100
    b) io_rd_wr.py
This script is generic LPC/io read/write utility (can also access system cpld)

steps to platform initialization (Tested with 3.16)

1) After power up of S6100 

     a) power up the io modules by executing (./iom_power.sh)
     b) insert i2c_mux_pca954x.ko,dell_s6100_iom_cpld.ko,dell_s6100_lpc.ko 

    Above 2 steps can be called by including them in below 2 step

2) Build i2c device tree/device initialization by calling below script

    ./s6100_platform_init.sh

3) IOM cpld devices are created under "/sys/bus/i2c/drivers/dell_s6100_iom_cpld/"
   QSFP handles via sysfs i2c bus #( 15,16,17,18-003e)
   iom_cpld_vers -- Displays CPLD version(RO)
   qsfp_lpmode   -- lpmode settings(RW)
   qsfp_modprs   -- modules presence (RO)
   qsfp_reset    -- reset settings (RW)

    ls /sys/bus/i2c/drivers/dell_s6100_iom_cpld/15-003e/
    driver/        iom_cpld_vers  modalias       name           power/         qsfp_lpmode    qsfp_modprs    qsfp_reset     subsystem/     uevent

4) step 2 script also builds/attach sfp device tress in sysfs

Subject: [PATCH 1/1] Put style as line number to ssh session environment
 variable

By default, the content between : and @ will be trimmed by sshd before it do
authentication and the trimmed string will be dropped silently. To use this
segment as line number for reverse SSH feature, we need to modify the source
code of OpenSSH and put this segment to a environment variable
SSH_TARGET_CONSOLE_LINE, then we can insert a short script into /etc/bash.bashrc
and run command consutil connect $SSH_TARGET_CONSOLE_LINE to enter the
management session automatically after user login.

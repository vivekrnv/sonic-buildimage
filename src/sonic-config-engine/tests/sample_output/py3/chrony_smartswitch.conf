# This directive enables kernel synchronisation (every 11 minutes) of the
# real-time clock. Note that it canâ€™t be used along with the 'rtcfile' directive.
#rtcsync

# Instead of having the kernel manage the real-time clock, have chrony do this
# instead. The reason for this is that if the system time and the real-time clock
# are signficantly different from the actual time, then the system time must be
# slewed, while the real-time clock can be stepped to the actual time. That way,
# when the device next reboots (whether it be cold, warm, or fast), it will come
# up with the actual time from the real-time clock.

# Step the system clock instead of slewing it if the adjustment is larger than

# Disabled because we don't want chrony to do any clock steps; it should only slew

# Get TAI-UTC offset and leap seconds from the system tz database.
# This directive must be commented out when using time sources serving

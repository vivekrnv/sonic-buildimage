# Note that "restrict" applies to both servers and clients, so a configuration
# that might be intended to block requests from certain clients could also end
# up blocking replies from your own upstream servers.

# By default, exchange time with everybody, but don't allow configuration.
# NTPsec doesn't establish peer associations, and so nopeer has no effect, and has been removed from here

# Local users may interrogate the ntp server more closely.
